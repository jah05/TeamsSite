# TeamsSite
Website/App that finds you a team/group to do certain activities. <br />
The url to open the website is http://localhost:8000/app/.<br />
To sign up an account, go to log in and there will be an option <br />

Some extra features that i've included are
* Allowing for a new user to register through a form.
* Give users ability to edit existing data in the database.
* More complex use of permissions/logins/logouts, where, for example, some users can edit/add data and some can't.
* Filtering/sorting data that you pull from the database.

Hope you'd enjoy!
